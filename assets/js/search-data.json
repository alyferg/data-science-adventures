Perhaps the most important of these for the novice are the training resources and information but there are also a raft of other sites blogs and tools that can can make the whole process more straightforward. . The initial choice when researching information or learning about Machine Learning is either utilising blogs or YouTube. Personally, I prefer to use YouTube as I find that a lot easier to follow and can also see the code and the results on the screen. Thats not to say that I don&#39;t use blogs that can provide a useful depth that perhaps YouTube doesn&#39;t and quite often the blogs such as my own include blocks of code that you can copy to try out for yourself. . The volume of videos on YouTube is incredible and many of them are really long. There a some the contain a full 12-hour course and 3 to 4-hour videos are not uncommon. The beauty of many of these videos is that they are properly indexed with chapter markings though some of the older ones don&#39;t. Many of the video descriptions also provide links to the code either on github or a website that can be downloaded to follow along. It is truly amazing the volume and quality of the content available on YouTube on the subject of Machine Learning and a testament to the community that are prepared to put so much time and effort in to disseminating their knowledge. . Here are some of the useful channels that I have discovered on YouTube. This is not intended as an exhaustive list or a recommendation or I can say is that I have found these particular channels very useful in in gaining the understanding I now have of the subject. There are many many more. . Simplilearn Siraj Raval 3blue1brown edeureka Tech with Tim . But this is perhaps the most comprehensive one I found about deep learning it is a full course and very worthy of your attention if you are serious about learning more. . Practical Deep Learning for Coders . In the same vain here are a number of of blogs/websites that I am found useful easy for following particular subjects or or looking up one particular Key area. . stackoverflow a great source of wisdom and answers on many subjects. freecodecamp.org some great articles, I particularly like the flow of many of them. Python Data Science Handbook comprehensive and structured list of Python Data Science topics. pythonguides plenty of help in Python with examples. kite another very detailed list of useful code and topics. . There are many many more available, I am sure you can find your own. . I am sure that there are many different tools out there that people will find particularly useful depending on their exact requirements. Here are 2 that I have found particularly useful. . Grepper . Githib . Finally, for comprehensive access to many publicly available datasets to play, test and learn from then look at Kaggle. They also run competitions from time to time to help hone your skills. . Kaggle . For the Data Science example in this blog I have chosen the &quot;modeschoice&quot; dataset. The statsmodels explanation of this dataset is; . The data, collected as part of a 1987 intercity mode choice study, are a sub-sample of 210 non-business trips between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne in which the traveler chooses a mode from four alternatives (plane, car, bus and train). . In this example we will be looking at &quot;Terminal Time&quot; i.e. the time waiting at the terminal for the chosen mode of transport. As the assumption of the survey is that when using a car there is zero waiting time. Therefore, we will be charting the average wait time of Air, Rail and Bus Transport. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import statsmodels.api as sm from matplotlib import pyplot as plt modechoice = sm.datasets.modechoice df = modechoice.load_pandas().data #check that the data is loaded and see how it looks df . individual mode choice ttme invc invt gc hinc psize . 0 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 69.0 | 59.0 | 100.0 | 70.0 | 35.0 | 1.0 | . 1 1.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 | 34.0 | 31.0 | 372.0 | 71.0 | 35.0 | 1.0 | . 2 1.0 | 3.0 | 0.0 | 35.0 | 25.0 | 417.0 | 70.0 | 35.0 | 1.0 | . 3 1.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.0 | 180.0 | 30.0 | 35.0 | 1.0 | . 4 2.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 64.0 | 58.0 | 68.0 | 68.0 | 30.0 | 2.0 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 835 209.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 27.0 | 510.0 | 82.0 | 20.0 | 1.0 | . 836 210.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 64.0 | 66.0 | 140.0 | 87.0 | 70.0 | 4.0 | . 837 210.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 | 44.0 | 54.0 | 670.0 | 156.0 | 70.0 | 4.0 | . 838 210.0 | 3.0 | 0.0 | 53.0 | 33.0 | 664.0 | 134.0 | 70.0 | 4.0 | . 839 210.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 12.0 | 540.0 | 94.0 | 70.0 | 4.0 | . 840 rows × 9 columns . #this gives us the average wait time for each mode air = df.groupby(&#39;mode&#39;)[&#39;ttme&#39;].mean() #view the table air . mode 1.0 61.009524 2.0 35.690476 3.0 41.657143 4.0 0.000000 Name: ttme, dtype: float64 . labels = [&#39;Plane - 61&#39;,&#39;Train - 35&#39;,&#39;Bus - 41&#39;, &#39;Car - 0&#39;] # plot the pie chart plot = air.plot.pie(labeldistance=None, autopct=&#39;%1.1f%%&#39;,figsize=(10, 10)) plt.legend(loc=&#39;best&#39;,title=&#39;Average wait time (mins)&#39;,title_fontsize=&#39;large&#39;,labels=labels) . &lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x7fd4b50e6940&gt; .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
